# publication-A-robust-collision-source-method-for-rank-adaptive-dynamical-low-rank-approximation

This code framework can be used to reproduce all numerical results of the paper "A robust collision source method for rank adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation". The code is written in the programming language Julia (Version 1.6.2).

The code uses the following Julia packages: PyPlot, NPZ, ProgressMeter, LinearAlgebra, GSL, FastTransforms, FastGaussQuadrature. Installing these packages can be done via the Julia package manager (https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).

To run the code, go into the Julia environment and type include("runLung.jl") and include("runLineSource.jl").
